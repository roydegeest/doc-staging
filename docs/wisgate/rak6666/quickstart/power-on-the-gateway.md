# Power on the Gateway

1. Attach the antennas

First and foremost, screw on the antennas. All 5 of them should be installed, two (2) antennas on the **bottom** (**Wi-Fi**, **GPS**) and three (3) on the **top** (**LoRa®**, **LTE**)

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Do not power the device if any antenna port has been left open. In case you do not desire to use one or more antenna feature, make sure to terminate the port with a **50 Ohm load**.
:::

2. Power on the Gateway

It is recommended to use a **CAT5 Cable** to provide power to the Gateway. Attach one end to the provided **PoE injector** and the other to the **Ethernet Port** (ETH) on the bottom of the casing.
