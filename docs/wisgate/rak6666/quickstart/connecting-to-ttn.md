# Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to use long range gateways to connect to an open-source, decentralized network to exchange data with Application. Learn more about The Things Network [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

- First, you should have connected your RAK7240 Outdoor LPWAN Gateway to the router in order to access the internet according to the method which has been introduced in the [Access the Internet](/wisgate/rak7240/quickstart/access-the-internet.html#access-the-internet) section of this document.
- Now go to the TTN Website: [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and Login. You will then see the following page:

:::tip üìù NOTE
 The Gateway EUI can be found either on the sticker on the casing or via the LoRa¬Æ Packet Forwarder page in the LoRa¬Æ Gateway menu once you log via the Web UI.

2. Select your [Frequency Plan](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequency-plans.html) depending on your location. This should populate the Router field. Optionally you can choose to enter the Gateway coordinates in the map‚Äôs upper right corner and select if the gateway is indoor or outdoor via the Antenna placement field below the map.

3. Upon successful registration you should see the following screen:

  caption="Gateway successfully connected to The Things Network (TTN)"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE
 By default, the Gateway is set to connect to TTN. For detailed information about advanced configuration options refer to the [LoRaWAN¬Æ Gateway Configuration](/user-manual/web-management-platform/lorawan-gateway-configuration.html#_1-lora¬Æ-packet-forwarder) section.
